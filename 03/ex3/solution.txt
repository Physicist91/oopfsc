1. Why is get_int1 a reasonable method while get_int2 is unsuitable?
get_int1 creates a reference to a memory allocated on the free store,
while get_int2 creates a reference to a memory that's local to the function get_int2 itself.
Therefore get_int1 will be useful but not get_int2.

2. delete p; p = 0;
is more sensible, because it frees up the memory of p allocated on the heap,
then assign 0 to p, i.e. p now points to 0x0, which is the null pointer (in some implementation).
On the contrary,
p = 0; delete p;
sets *p as value at memory location 0x0, then frees up that memory
(but the allocated memory on the heap is still there!)
