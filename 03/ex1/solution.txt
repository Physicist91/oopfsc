i + 1 //correct,
i int, return int

*p //correct,
return  int

*p + 3 //correct,
*p int, return int

&i == p //incorrect if what you mean is "compare the value of i and the value pointed by p", this compares the memory locations

i == *p //correct
i int, *p int, return bool

&p //valid, memory address of p

p + 1 //incorrect if what you mean is "add 1 to the value pointed by p", this is 1 memory location away from memory address pointed by p

&p == i //incorrect, this is comparing memory location of p with the value of i??

**(&p) //correct
equivalent to *p, return int

*p + i > i //correct
*p int, i int, return bool
