1. A pointer with value 0 is the null pointer.

2. Node and List are implemented in exercise4/linked_list.cpp

3. Node and List are implemented in exercise4/linked_list.cpp

4. Tested, results are in supplement4.txt

5. We have not defined a copy constructor, so
a copying like that will not give the intended result, but only
creating a new list2 with head and tail initialized to nullptr.
If both lists are deleted by invoking the destructor, the memory on the heap
,that the class elements head and tail point to, will be deallocated.
