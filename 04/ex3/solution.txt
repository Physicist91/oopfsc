In the case of bar:
v[0] is of type int* (pointer to int)
bar() returns const int* (pointer to const int)
This is illegal because we are trying to cast 'const int*' to 'int *'

In the case of foo:
int** is a pointer to a "pointer to int"
const int** is a pointer to a "pointer of const int"
Therefore, they are two pointers of different types, not just of different const-ness!
What is allowed is casting T* into T const *, for e.g.
casting "int**" to "int * const *": casting pointer to "pointer to int" into pointer to "const pointer to int"
