1)Which type of container is suitable for storing the node values?
Vector: it is suitable to store the grid numbers consecutively and can be accessed randomly.

2)Which type of container is well suited to save the pivot elements and which to store the data itself?
The sequence adaptor std::stack as container (to use the helpful interfaces such as top() and pop()),
and std::pair to store the data itself (the start and end index of a partition). Such an implementation is in quickSort.cpp

3)What type of container would you use as a FIFO?
std::queue, because it's the one that fulfills the FIFO requirement.

4)In what container you would store the indices of Dirichlet nodes and their values?
list:it will give access to value node by node and also it free the memory which will make it posibble to use it for big problems.
