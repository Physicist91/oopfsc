Firstly, we created a new directory
$ mkdir oop-sheet1; cd oop-sheet1

Then we initialize a new git repository
$ git init #initialize a new git repository

We put a text file "a.c" (later renamed main.c to conform to submission rules),
then add it to the files tracked by git and commit the changes.
$ git add a.c #was later renamed to "main.c"
$ git commit -m "First commit."

Then we read the log file
$ git log #to confirm that the commit was successful

Then we checked the status of the working directory
$ git status # the status was clean

Next we changed something in the file, added and committed it,
but then we reverted the commit.
$ git add a.c
$ git commit -m "Changed something."
$ git reset HEAD~ #to undo the commit

Then we edited the file again, and stash the changes
$ git stash

Then we created a new project on Gitlab,
and used it to add "origin" to our repository, and pushed
$ git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/kevin.sis/oop-sheet1.git
$ git push origin master

Then we got the private repository to Gitlab,
(the project was later renamed to "OOPFSC2018-HussainSiswandi"),
and use the URL to create another copy of the repository on our local machine
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/kevin.sis/oop-sheet1.git

Then we performed a quick edit to "a.c" on Gitlab and committed it directly.
Then we changed a different line on our computer and pull
$ git add a.c
$ git commit -m "Changed on local."
$ git pull

Then we edited the line that was changed locally on Gitlab too
We tried pulling on our local repository:
$ git pull #this caused conflicts

We then accepted our version
$ git checkout --ours a.c
$ git add a.c
$ git commit -m "Accepting our version."

Then we reapply the changes that have been stashed
$ git stash pop
