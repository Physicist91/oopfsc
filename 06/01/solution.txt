The class my_exception is implemented in "main.cc"
When executing the program, the following error occured:

libc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type my_exception: Foo exception
Abort trap: 6

The main reason for abortion is because when b is created it thows an exception.
Then, it starts the stack unwinding trying to destroy all objects created so far,
in order to handle the exception. In this case it destroys f which throws another exception.
Since the program cannot manage an exception while it is doing stack unwinding, it aborts the execution.

The section 15.2 point 3 of C++ standard is sensible because it means that an object cannot fail in its destruction,
or at least if it fails, it must be recovered in place and not throw an exception outside of the destruction call.
