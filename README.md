# Object Oriented Programming for Scientific Computing

Glossary:
- A *class* consists of methods and attributes
- An *object* is an instance of a class
- *Attributes* describe or characterise an object/class
- *Methods* are actions that an object/class can execute

The central idea behind OOP is **encapsulation**: combining functions and data into a class.
